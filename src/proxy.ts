 * Pre-launch gate.
 *
 * While the site is not launched, every page request is rewritten to the
 * coming-soon page. The visitor keeps the URL they asked for, but the only
 * page they can ever see is the holding page — the marketplace, dashboard,
 * auth pages and finance tools are all unreachable.
 *
 *   SITE_LAUNCHED=true        → gate off, the whole site is open
 *   (unset / anything else)   → gated (the safe default)
 *
 * Two ways to preview while gated (both need PREVIEW_TOKEN set):
 *   - /preview — a friendly 4-digit PIN page for demos/presentations.
 *   - opening any URL once with `?preview=<PREVIEW_TOKEN>`.
 * Either sets a cookie so you (and only you) can browse the real site for a
 * week.
